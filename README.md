I will recreate the Rock Paper Scissors game in this project! I'll learn more about randomizing functions, and I'll get to practice conditional statements. Doing this project will also give me a chance to practice loops. I hope to learn more about arrays soon, but I don't think I'll need arrays for this project.

Turns out, I didn't need arrays for this project, but I'll be learning more about arrays soon.

I practiced making loops. I also read about getting random numbers. I found a function on Mozilla's website, which was very helpful. Their function, getRandomInt(max), returns a random integer-number leading up to the value placed inside it's parameters, "max."

I feel confident enough to upload my project, now that I've tested my project multiple times inside my Chrome Browser.

I'm now creating a very lively project. My project includes images with corresponding event listeners added to them.
I've added event listeners that check for hover events. These events will scale my images.
I've also added event listeners that check for click events. These events run animations and cause the player to make progress in the game.

I decided to conclude my project. I learned a little bit more about how to animate with CSS and JavaScript. I also learned the importance of creating useful functions. I created a very simple game that allows a person to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
