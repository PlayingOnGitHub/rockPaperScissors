I will recreate the Rock Paper Scissors game in this project! I'll learn more about randomizing functions, and I'll get to practice conditional statements. Doing this project will also give me a chance to practice loops. I hope to learn more about arrays soon, but I don't think I'll need arrays for this project.

Turns out, I didn't need arrays for this project, but I'll be learning more about arrays soon.

I practiced making loops. I also read about getting random numbers. I found a function on Mozilla's website, which was very helpful. Their function, getRandomInt(max), returns a random integer-number leading up to the value placed inside it's parameters, "max."

I feel confident enough to upload my project, now that I've tested my project multiple times inside my Chrome Browser.

I'm now creating a very lively project. My project includes images with corresponding event listeners added to them.

I've added event listeners that check for hover events. These events will scale my images.
I've also added event listeners that check for click events. These events run animations and cause the player to make progress in the game.

I need to clean up the following css classes noted.. and then sweep the file because there are some styles left over from other tests.

class = player-selection-image-properties
class = computer-selection-image-properties

class = computer-selection-div-properties [add a color to observe the spacing]
class = player-selection-div-properties [is currently green for placement purposes
class = animation-background [currently is orange]

id = #move-computer-selection [runs animation]
id = #move-player-selection [runs animation]
