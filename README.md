I will recreate the Rock Paper Scissors game in this project! I'll learn more about randomizing functions, and I'll get to practice conditional statements. Doing this project will also give me a chance to practice loops. I hope to learn more about arrays soon, but I don't think I'll need arrays for this project.

Turns out, I didn't need arrays for this project, but I'll be learning more about arrays soon.

I practiced making loops. I also read about getting random numbers. I found a function on Mozilla's website, which was very helpful. Their function, getRandomInt(max), returns a random integer-number leading up to the value placed inside it's parameters, "max."

I feel confident enough to upload my project, now that I've tested my project multiple times inside my Chrome Browser.
